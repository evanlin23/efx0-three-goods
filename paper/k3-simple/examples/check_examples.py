"""Recompute every example and every computed number of paper/k3-simple/long.tex, and test its lemmas and algorithm DE.

    python3 paper/k3-simple/examples/check_examples.py          (from the repository root, or from anywhere)

Exit status 0 iff every check passes. One process, no pools; about a minute. check_output.txt (same folder) is a
copy of what this script prints.

This script implements the definitions of long.tex as now written (states and scores, wants, validity, free agents,
leftover goods, blockers, finishing and completions, want arrows and pair arrows, rings, chains) and algorithm DE
(Algorithm 1: peeling by rule R1, the draft, then the loop chain / finish / ring), written from the paper's text and
not from earlier code. Every claim of the proofs that DE relies on is an assert. Allocations are checked against the
raw definition of EFX0 with exact integer arithmetic. `k3/simplify/po/hall/hall.py`, an older implementation, is used
only for cross-checks of claims that are still the same: the improving step of the Improvement Lemma, and DE's output.

Sections (as printed):
  [1] Introduction: Example "EFX, but not EFX0"; three goods break serial dictatorship; Corollary "two relevant goods".
  [2] Section 6, "A small example" (also in main.tex): three agents, one ring with one pair arrow, then a completion.
  [3] Section 7 "A Worked Example" and Figure 1: the draft state, wants, free agents, blockers, the sets H_o, the ten
      candidate completions, no small trade, the four dominating valid states, the arrows and cycles, DE's ring and
      final allocation, raw EFX0 (values 4, 3, 2 and 2,000 random strictly balanced valuations with these rankings).
  [4] Appendix A, Proposition "when short moves are not enough": both instances, and the remark that two of the four
      cycles with two pair arrows reuse a leftover good.
  [5] Appendix A, "No bounded number of pair arrows suffices": the ring family for k <= 4 and depths d <= 3, and DE
      from the draft at depth 4 (Conclusion, open problem (2)).
  [6] Appendix B: Lemma "cases of safety" and Proposition "limits of the shape", by listing every allocation.
  [7] Every valid state of every core profile with n = 2 (m <= 6) and n = 3 (m <= 7), up to renaming goods: the
      draft (Lemma "the draft", every order), the finishing test, soundness (every completion), Lemma "ring" (every
      ring), the Improvement Lemma in the form of its proof, short moves (Proposition: none missing for n <= 5), and
      the loop of DE started at every valid state.
  [8] DE, peeling included, on random instances; comparison with the loop of the previous version of the paper and
      with hall.py.
