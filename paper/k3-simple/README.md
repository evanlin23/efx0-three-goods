# Paper: EFX₀ with at most three relevant goods per agent

The paper of this repository's k = 3 result: every instance with nonnegative additive valuations in which each agent
positively values at most three goods has a complete EFX₀ allocation, in which all bundles but at most one have at
most two goods, and algorithm Draft and Exchange (DE) computes one in time O(n(n + m)), with at most 4n trades. After
peeling and a draft, DE's loop has three steps: a chain (an agent holding its top takes its two other goods, both
leftover), finish (a free agent takes the leftover goods, each of its blockers' leftover goods going to another free
agent), or a ring of trades. The proof rests on the Improvement Lemma: in a valid state in which no free agent can
finish, a chain or a ring makes some agent better off and nobody worse off; the ring exists because every agent can
point at an agent that would gladly take its good. It is written in
Springer's LLNCS format, 11pt, in two versions that share the bibliography and the class files. This is the paper
intended for publication; the papers are self-contained. Their novelty claim (§1, "What is new") rests on the
literature search of `proofs/novelty.md` (25 September 2026).

- `main.tex` → `main.pdf`: the short version (LLNCS, about 9 pages of body before the references), readable on its own:
  what is new (with an instance no earlier result covers),
  peeling, states, finishing (with the soundness proof), improving (chain, ring, the finishing test, the Improvement
  Lemma, all with proofs), DE with pseudocode and a three-agent example; in the appendix the short proofs of §2–§3,
  the corollary on Pareto-optimal states, the worked example with its figure, how large a ring must be, the limits
  of the shape, the verification in detail and the related-work table.
- `long.tex` → `long.pdf`: the same proof with more explanation (an overview, every proof in the body, the
  three-agent example, the worked example with a TikZ figure of the ring) and the same appendices. The earlier,
  longer version (30 pages, with the need and exchange digraphs, a six-case loop and the threat/safety lemmas in the
  body) is in the git history up to commit `d21d3f7`.
- `refs.bib`: the bibliography of both; `Repo` is this repository at commit `4c303bf`, which holds the notes, tests,
  referee reports and Lean files.
- `llncs.cls` and `splncs04.bst`: Springer's LLNCS package, unmodified.
- `examples/check_examples.py`: an independent implementation of the definitions of `long.tex` (wants, free agents,
  blockers, finishing, want and pair arrows, rings, chains) and of DE with its loop chain / finish / ring, written
  from the paper's text, that recomputes every example and number of the paper: Example EFX-but-not-EFX₀ and
  Corollary two relevant goods; the small example of §6; the worked example of §7 (draft state, wants, free agents,
  blockers, the sets H_o, all 10 candidate completions failing, no short move, the 4 dominating valid states, the
  arrows and cycles of Figure 1, DE's ring and output, raw EFX₀, also for 2,000 random valuations); both instances of
  Proposition short moves and the remark on the reused leftover good; the ring family for k ≤ 4, d ≤ 3, and DE's
  trades on it at depth 4; Lemma cases of safety and Proposition limits of the shape, by listing every allocation;
  on all 30,507 valid states of the core profiles with n = 2 (m ≤ 6) and n = 3 (m ≤ 7), up to renaming goods, the
  finishing test, soundness (every completion), Lemma ring (every ring), the Improvement Lemma in the form of its
  proof and DE's loop started there; DE, peeling included, on 40,000 random instances, and the instance of "What is new" (that no earlier result's
  hypotheses hold for it, and DE on 2,000 random value draws), compared with the loop of
  the previous version (an agent holding nothing finishing first) and with `k3/simplify/po/hall/hall.py`. Run from
  the repository root: `python3 paper/k3-simple/examples/check_examples.py` (one process, about a minute; output
  copied to `examples/check_output.txt`; exit status 0 iff every check passes).

Status of the claims, as the papers state it. Every result of the papers is a written proof that is also
machine-checked in Lean, except the rainbow-walk second proof of the Improvement Lemma:
- the Improvement Lemma, soundness, DE with its 3-step loop and at most 4n trades, and the shape
  (`lean/EFX/K3DE.lean`, `K3DEImprove.lean`, `K3DEAlgo.lean`, `K3DEExamples.lean`; ledger row K3S.PO.LEAN; the Lean
  names are the earlier ones: needs for wants, exposed for blocker, protecting good for leftover good, valid
  absorber for an agent that can finish);
- the lemmas of §2, Lemma cases of safety and Proposition limits of the shape (Appendix B), Proposition short moves
  with its instances and the ring family (Appendix A; every k and depth), the worked example's facts, Example
  EFX-but-not-EFX₀, at most n peeling rounds, and DE on ordered values such as ℝ≥0 (`lean/EFX/K3DEPrelim.lean`,
  `K3DELimits.lean`, `K3DEShort.lean`, `K3DEShortExamples.lean`, `K3DERings.lean`, `K3DEReal.lean`,
  `K3DERemarks.lean`; ledger rows K3S.PRELIM.LEAN, K3S.LIMITS, K3S.SHORT, K3S.EX.LEAN, K3S.RINGS, K3S.REAL.LEAN);
- the running time O(n(n + m)) (`lean/EFX/K3DECost*.lean`, ledger row K3S.TIME: at most 750 (n + 1)(n + m + 1)
  counted operations, array reads and writes one unit each).

The formal statements were written by AI assistant sessions; independent AI referee sessions compared them with the
papers (`k3/simplify/po/referee/lean_audit.md`, `lean_audit2.md`, `lean_audit3.md` for the earlier version;
`lean_audit4.md` for the simplified one, whose two blocking mismatches, the tie-break among leftover goods and the
per-agent gains of a ring, are resolved). The written proof was derived independently twice
(`k3/simplify/po/hall/NOTES.md`, `k3/simplify/po/potential/NOTES.md`) and refereed once with no error
(`k3/simplify/po/referee/README.md`); the simplified presentation was refereed once more, by a session that read only
`long.tex`: no mathematical error, four one-line gaps fixed (`k3/simplify/po/referee/simple/REPORT.md`, with its own
implementation of DE and its tests, zero failures on about 14.9 million instances). The provers and referees were AI
agents: separate sessions of the coding assistant (Claude Code). There has been no human peer review. Every claim is
taken from `LEDGER.md` (the rows above, and K3S.PO, K3S.SA, K3S.ST) and the notes it cites, or from the runs of
`examples/check_examples.py`; the papers change no ledger status.
