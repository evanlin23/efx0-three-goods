# Algorithm DE on small instances (non-vacuity; ledger K3S.PO.LEAN)

The outputs below are computed by kernel evaluation (`decide`) of `EFX.DE.deSpec` and `EFX.DE.deMoves`, and they are
EFX₀ with at most one large bundle by `EFX.DE.deSpec_correct`.

- `worked`: the worked example of `paper/k3-simple/long.tex` §6 (n = 6, m = 10, values 4, 3, 2): the draft state has
  no need cycle and no pair chain, no free agent absorbs, and one exchange cycle with two exposure arcs
  (`o₁ → x₁ → o₂ → x₂ → o₁`) gives two pairs; then `x₁'` absorbs with `H = ∅`. The output is the paper's.
- `twoAgents`: the remark "the protecting goods cannot be dropped" (n = 2, m = 3): both agents hold their tops, each
  is exposed for the other, and agent 0 absorbs with `H = {g₂}`, which goes to agent 1. No exchange.
- `chains`: n = 2, m = 5: (P) fails after the draft, a pair chain (agent 0 takes its pair, agent 1 takes `g₀`),
  then (P) fails at agent 1, a second pair chain of length 0, and every agent is a pair holder; agent 0 absorbs.
- `peeled`: `chains` with a third agent that values only `g₅`; rule R1 peels it with `g₅` first.
