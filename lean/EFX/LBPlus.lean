# Construction LB⁺ and Theorem C (`proofs/lb_last_step.md` §6)

`EFX.LB.lbPlus` is construction LB⁺, with Phase 1's processing order as an argument:
1. Phase 1 in `order` (`phase1`); LB's upgrades (`lbUp`).
2. If the junk fits the slots (`ω ≤ 0`), the completion without owner.
3. Otherwise let `r` be the last agent not upgraded (`lastOut`). If `r` is a valid owner (Lemma 1's
   condition holds for some `H`; by `validOwner_iff` exactly when `H = hitSet` fits), the completion with
   owner `r` and `H = hitSet`.
4. Otherwise the bad case holds (Theorem A, `theoremA_invalid`): rotate along the need chain from `k*` to `r`
   (`rotPicks`, `k*` upgraded), and return the completion of the rotated pre-allocation without owner if its
   junk fits its slots, and with owner `k*` and `H = hitSet` otherwise (Theorem B).

LB⁺ has no failure case: it always returns an allocation (`G → A`).

LB⁺ over all its choices (`LBPlusRun`, `LBPlusOut`): Phase 1 in any order with R1 priority, the upgrades in
any order (`UpFinal`), any need chain from `k*` to `r` (`NeedChain`), and any completions (`Completion`).

- `lbPlusRun_sound`: **Theorem C, over all choices**: every output is a complete allocation, EFX₀ for every
  additive valuation consistent with the rankings (ties allowed), with at most one bundle of more than two
  goods. `lbPlusOut_exists`: LB⁺ never meets an undefined case (for every order and every end state of the
  upgrades, an output exists). `lbPlus_run`: the computable `lbPlus` is one of the outputs.
- `lbPlus_sound`: **Theorem C** for `lbPlus`; `lbPlus_sound_model`: the same in the model's terms
  (`EFX.Inst.EFX0`).

The agent `d` is a default that only unreachable branches use (LB⁺ with no agent not upgraded).
