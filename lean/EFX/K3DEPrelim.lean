# Draft and Exchange, preliminaries: threats, safety and peeling

The statements of §3 of the short proof of the k = 3 result (`paper/k3-simple/long.tex` §3.1 "Model, threats and
safety" and §3.2 "Peeling"), over the list layer of `EFX/Lists.lean` (agents and goods are lists, an allocation is an
owner map `X : G → A`, the bundle of `j` is `bundle goods X j`).

**Definitions.**
- `leastValue`, `threat`: the threat `θ_i(B) = v_i(B) − min_{h ∈ B} v_i(h)` of a list of goods `B` to agent `i`
  (`θ_i(∅) = 0`); `threat_eq_max`: by additivity it is the largest value of `v_i(B ∖ {h})` over `h ∈ B`
  (`threat_le_iff`: `θ_i(B) ≤ x` iff `v_i(B ∖ {h}) ≤ x` for every `h ∈ B`).
- `Safe`: agent `i` is safe in `X` if `v_i(X_i) ≥ θ_i(X_j)` for every listed agent `j ≠ i`.
- `Alone`: a good is alone in `X` if it is the only good of its bundle.
- `rankO`, `Gy`: the rank of `y` (`3` for `⊥`), and `G_y`, the goods that `i` ranks above `y` (`G_⊥ = R_i`,
  `gy_none_iff`).

**Results.**
- `efx0L_iff_safe` (lists), `efx0_iff_safe` (the model's `EFX.Inst.EFX0`): `X` is EFX₀ iff every agent is safe.
- **Lemma threats**: (a) `threat_of_length_le_one`; (b) `threat_le_relevant` (`B ∩ R_i` is `relevant v i B`);
  (c) `threat_pair`, and `threat_of_perm_pair` for any list holding the two goods (`threat_perm`).
- **Lemma safety** for a balanced agent with exactly three relevant goods: (a) `safe_of_pair`; (b) `safe_of_gy`.
- **§3.2, mapped to existing theorems** (the last section of this file):
  - Lemma peeling is `EFX.peel` (`P = {p}`) and `EFX.peelEmpty` (`P = ∅`), both instances of `EFX.peelBundle`;
    `peeling` states the paper's version, `|P| ≤ 1`, in one theorem.
  - Rule R1 is `EFX.K3.r1Step` (favourite with ties in list order, so by index over `List.finRange`): `some none`
    (leave with nothing, `EFX.K3.r1Step_none_zero`), `some (some p)` (leave with `p`, `EFX.K3.r1Step_some`), or
    `none` (R1 does not apply).
  - Corollary "two relevant goods" is `EFX.Inst.sdRun_efx0` (and `EFX.sdRun_efx0` over lists, `EFX/K3Extras.lean`):
    `EFX.SDRun` is every run of serial dictatorship in any order of the agents, with any favourite at every step,
    nothing once no good is left, the last agent taking all remaining goods. This is the paper's statement; the
    `example`s below check the type. (`EFX.serialDictatorship` and `EFX.exists_efx0_of_count` are only the
    existence form.)
  - Lemma "when R1 applies to nobody" is `EFX.not_R1` with `EFX.K3.r1Step_eq_none`. `EFX.not_R1`'s hypothesis is
    "no good `p` has `v_i(G ∖ {p}) ≤ v_i(p)`" (not rule R1 itself) and its conclusion "at least three relevant
    goods, and `2 v_i(g) < v_i(G)` for every `g`", so `R1fail` states the paper's version: R1 as `EFX.K3.r1Step`,
    at most three relevant goods; conclusion exactly three, and strictly balanced. `r1_of_two` is the paper's
    remark that R1 applies to every agent valuing at most two remaining goods.

**Choices where the prose leaves room.**
1. Sets of goods are lists: a bundle is `bundle goods X j`, a filter of the duplicate-free list `goods`;
   `B ∩ R_i` is `relevant v i B`; the set `{g, h}` is any list that is a permutation of `[g, h]`.
2. Lemma threats (c) is proved for every two goods (for `g = h` the list `[g, g]` is not a set, and the formula
   still holds); the paper assumes `g ≠ h`.
3. Lemma safety: "a balanced agent with `|R_i| = 3`" is an agent of a ranking profile `P` (`EFX.LB.Profile`) with
   `P.Consistent agents v`: it values exactly `a i`, `b i`, `c i`, with `a ≥ b ≥ c > 0` and `a ≤ b + c`. Ties are
   allowed and the ranking may be any ranking consistent with the values (the paper's tie-break by index is one).
   `y : Option G` with `none = ⊥`; "`y ∈ X_i ∩ R_i`" is `y ∈ X_i` and `v_i(y) > 0`; "`i` is safe, unless `E`" is
   `¬ E → Safe`.
4. Safety and EFX₀ are towards the listed agents; the agents need not be distinct.
5. Peeling: `P` is a list of at most one good of `goods`, `M ∖ P` is `goods.filter (· ∉ P)`, and "`Z` together with
   `X_i = P`" is the owner map `fun g => if g ∈ P then i else Z g`.

/-- **Lemma "when R1 applies to nobody".** Let agent `i` value at most three goods of the remaining goods `G`,
and suppose that rule R1 (`EFX.K3.r1Step`: the favourite `p`, ties in list order; `i` leaves with nothing if
`v_i(p) = 0` and with `p` if `v_i(G ∖ {p}) ≤ v_i(p)`) does not apply to `i`. Then `i` values exactly three goods of
`G` and is strictly balanced: every good of `G` is worth less to `i` than the other goods of `G` together (for its
top `a`, `v_i(a) < v_i(b) + v_i(c)`). -/

/-- **Corollary "two relevant goods"** is `EFX.Inst.sdRun_efx0`: every run of serial dictatorship (`EFX.SDRun`),
in any order of all agents, each agent taking a favourite remaining good (or nothing once no good is left) and the
