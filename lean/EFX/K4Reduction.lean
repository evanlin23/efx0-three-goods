# The k = 4 core reduction (`k4/SCOUT.md` §2, K4.CORE)

- `sharedGoods`: the goods of `goods` relevant to `i` and to some other agent.
- `IsCore4`: a *k = 4 core* (`k4/SCOUT.md` §2, K4.CORE): at least two agents; (C1) every agent has 3 or 4
  relevant goods; (C2) every agent is strictly balanced, each good worth less than its other goods together;
  (C3) an agent with `d` relevant goods has at most `d − 2` private goods (relevant to no other agent): at
  most 1 with 3 goods, at most 2 with 4; (C4) an agent with two private goods `p, q` values them less than
  its shared goods `s, t`, `v(p) + v(q) < v(s) + v(t)`; (C5) every good is relevant to some agent.
- `Connected`: the agents are connected through the goods (no split of the agents into two nonempty sides
  such that no good is relevant to agents on both sides).
- `efx0_split`: **L6 (components)**. EFX₀ allocations of the two sides of such a split combine into one.
- `core_reduction4_conn`: **K4.CORE**. If every *connected* k = 4 core with at most `N` agents has an EFX₀
  allocation, so does every instance with at most `N` agents in which every agent has at most four relevant
  goods. The induction of `EFX.core_reduction` (`proofs/lemmas.md`, CORE), which never uses k: junk goods by
  L3 (`EFX.junk`), then peeling by R1 (`EFX.peel`), then by R2 (`EFX.peelR2`, applied whenever its balance
  condition `v_i(R_i ∖ P) ≤ v_i(P)` holds), then L6 (`efx0_split`); what remains is a connected k = 4 core.
- `core_reduction4`: the same for all k = 4 cores, connected or not.
- `core_reduction4_mixed`: only the connected k = 4 cores that have an agent with four relevant goods are
  needed: a k = 4 core whose agents all have three goods is a core in the sense of `EFX.IsCore`, which
  Corollary D (`EFX.LB.corollaryD_lists`) covers.
- `target4_of_cores`: `core_reduction4_mixed` in the model's terms (`EFX.Inst`, `numRelevant I i ≤ 4`).

positively values at most four goods (`|R_i| ≤ 4`), then `I` has a complete EFX₀ allocation. -/
