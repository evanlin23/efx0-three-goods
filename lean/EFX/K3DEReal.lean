# Draft and Exchange on ordered values, and the peeling bound (`paper/k3-simple/long.tex` §6.2)

`EFX/K3DEAlgo.lean` formalizes algorithm DE and Theorem "DE is correct" (`thm:de`) over natural-number values, with
the bound of `4n` exchanges. This file adds the two parts of §6.2 that it leaves out: the bound "DE peels at most
`n` agents" of `thm:de`, and the last sentence of the proof of Theorems `thm:target`, `thm:D` and `thm:algo`: the
results "hold for nonnegative real values, with the step count of Theorem `thm:algo` in the comparison model".
Core Lean has no reals: values lie in any `EFX.OrderedValue` type `V` (`ℝ≥0` satisfies its axioms by the textbook
fact), as in `EFX/RealValues.lean` and `EFX/K3Real.lean`.

**Peeling rounds.** `peels v fuel agents goods` follows the recursion of `EFX.DE.run` case by case and adds one in
the two cases in which `run` peels, those in which `EFX.K3.findR1` returns `some (i, s)`: agent `i` leaves with
nothing (`s = none`) or with its favourite remaining good (`s = some p`). `run` itself is unchanged.
- `peels_stop`, `run_peels_step` (**the rounds counted are `run`'s R1 rounds**): `peels` is `0` when `run` stops
  without consulting `findR1` (no fuel, at most one agent, or no goods); otherwise, with at least two agents and some
  goods, the one combined recursion lemma unfolds `run` and `peels` together: if `findR1` returns `some (i, none)` or
  `some (i, some p)`, `run` recurses on the agents without `i` (and the goods without `p`) and `peels` is one more
  than on those same arguments; if it returns `none`, `run` is the core stage `deStage` and `peels` is `0`.
- `peels_le`, `dePeels_le_pred`, `dePeels_le` (**DE peels at most `n` agents**): every round removes one agent and
  the rounds stop at one agent, so `peels ≤ |agents| - 1`; for the model (`dePeels`), at most `n - 1 ≤ n`.
- `de_correct` (**Theorem `thm:de`** over the natural numbers, in full): EFX₀, all bundles but at most one of at
  most two goods, at most `n` peeled agents and at most `4n` exchanges (`EFX.DE.deSpec_correct` plus `dePeels_le`).

**DE on ordered values** (`deOrd le I hn`), as K3ALG in `EFX.K3.algoOrd`: compute the natural-number surrogate
`w = EFX.K3.surrogate le I` of Lemma L12 with the comparison oracle `le : V → V → Bool`, and run DE
(`EFX.DE.deSpec`) on the instance `⟨n, m, w⟩`. `deOrdMoves` and `deOrdPeels` are its exchanges and peeling rounds.
- `deOrd_eq_surrogateC`: the surrogate is the value of the counted program `EFX.K3.surrogateC`, which asks the
  oracle at most `n (m + 12)` times (`EFX.K3.surrogateC_cost`, the coefficient of the charge `c` per call); DE then
  runs on `w` and asks the oracle nothing.
- `deOrd_correct` (**Theorem `thm:de` on ordered values**): for a correct oracle (`∀ x y, le x y = true ↔ x ≤ y`),
  nonnegative values and at most three relevant goods per agent, `deOrd le I hn` is EFX₀ for the *original* values
  (`OInst.EFX0`), all its bundles but at most one have at most two goods, and DE peels at most `n` agents and
  applies at most `4n` exchanges on the surrogate. Proof: `w` agrees with `v` on every comparison of two subset sums
  (`EFX.K3.agree_surrogate`), so it has the same relevant goods (`EFX.numRelevant_eq_of_agree`) and the same EFX₀
  allocations (`EFX.efx0_iff_of_agree`), and `de_correct` applies to `w`.
- `thmD_ordered` (**Theorems `thm:target` and `thm:D` on ordered values, in general**): every instance with
  `n ≥ 1` agents, nonnegative values in `V` and at most three relevant goods per agent has an EFX₀ allocation in
  which all bundles but at most one have at most two goods. It needs neither exactly three relevant goods nor
  balance, unlike `EFX.corollaryD_ordered`, and it implies `EFX.target_ordered`. Proof: L12 (`EFX.l12`) and
  `EFX.DE.deSpec_correct`.
- `Examples.peeledZ_surrogate`, `Examples.peeledZ_deOrd`: an instance with values in `Int` (one peel, then two pair
  chains): its surrogate and DE's output, checked by `decide`.

**Choices where the prose leaves room.**
1. *The comparison model.* The paper counts each decision of DE on real values as one comparison of two sums of at
   most two values of one agent. Here, as for K3ALG, the oracle is asked only while the surrogate is computed
   (`m + 12` calls per agent, comparisons of sums of at most two values of one agent, with repetition for the
   phantom slots: see `EFX/K3Real.lean`), and DE's decisions are then made on the natural numbers `w`. Every
   decision of DE on `w` (the favourite and R1's test `w_i(p) ≥ w_i(G ∖ {p})`, the zero test, the rankings) is a
   comparison of two subset sums of one agent's values, which `w` answers as `v` does; this per-decision
   correspondence is the reason the outcome is right, but what is formalized is the outcome (`deOrd_correct`), not
   a trace of DE's comparisons on `V`.
2. *Peeling with no goods left.* `run` stops when no goods remain; the paper's loop would go on peeling agents
   with `P = ∅` until one is left. With no goods there is nothing to allocate, so the allocations agree; `peels`
   counts `run`'s rounds, and both counts are at most `n`.
3. `peels` takes no default agent: the control flow of `run` does not depend on it.
4. The running time `O(n(n + m))` of the paper and the cost of DE on the surrogate are not formalized (as in
   `EFX/K3DEAlgo.lean`); the counts of oracle calls, peeling rounds and exchanges are.
