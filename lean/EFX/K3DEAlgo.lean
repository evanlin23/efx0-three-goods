# Draft and Exchange, part 3: the algorithm and its correctness (ledger K3S.PO.LEAN)

Algorithm DE of `paper/k3-simple/long.tex` §6, as a computable function, and Theorem "DE is correct":

1. **Peeling** (`run`): while at least two agents and some goods remain, the first agent to which rule R1 applies
   leaves, with its favourite remaining good or with nothing (`EFX.K3.findR1`, as in `EFX.K3.reduce`); one agent left
   takes everything.
2. **The core** (`deStage`): when R1 applies to nobody, every remaining agent values exactly three goods and is
   strictly balanced (`EFX.not_R1`); its ranking is computed by sorting (`EFX.K3.profileOf`). The draft is
   serial dictatorship in the order of `agents` (`EFX.LB.phase1`, a valid state: `draft_valid`). Then `loop` repeats
   `step` (need cycles, pair chains and exchange cycles) until it stops with a valid absorber `o` and its set `H`,
   and the completion `completeDE` gives each good of `H` to a different free agent and the rest of the junk to `o`.

**Results.**
- `draft_valid` (**Lemma draft**): the draft is a valid state with no pair holder.
- `loop_spec`: from a valid state, with enough fuel, the loop ends at a valid state with a valid absorber, and the
  number of exchanges is at most the increase of the sum of utilities, which lies in `[0, 4n]`.
- `deStage_sound`: the core stage returns a complete EFX₀ allocation in which every bundle but one has at most two
  goods, after at most `4n` exchanges.
- `run_sound` (**Theorem DE is correct**, lists) and `deSpec_correct` (the model's instances): on every instance in
  which every agent positively values at most three goods, DE returns a complete EFX₀ allocation in which all bundles
  but at most one have at most two goods, after at most `4n` exchanges.

The running time `O(n(n + m))` of the paper is not formalized; the count of exchanges is.
