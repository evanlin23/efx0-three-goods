# Draft and Exchange, part 4: when short moves are not enough (Proposition short)

Proposition "when short moves are not enough" of `paper/k3-simple/long.tex` §6.4 (`prop:short`; written source
`k3/simplify/po/potential/NOTES.md`, Lemma 3), over the states of `EFX/K3DE.lean` (a pick map `Y` and a list `up`
of pair holders, `EFX.LB.Valid`). The worked example of §6.3 and the instances that attain the bounds are in
`EFX/K3DEShortExamples.lean`.

**Definitions.**
- `NeedArc j j'` (an arc of the need digraph `D`, paper Definition need digraph): `j` and `j'` are listed agents
  outside `up`, `j` holds the single good `y` (`Y j = some y`), and `j'` needs it (`P.Prefers Y j' y`).
  `needArcB` decides it.
- `HasNeedCycle`: `D` has a closed walk `j → ⋯ → j` (`Relation.TransGen` of `NeedArc`).
- `PairChain`: a pair chain applies, i.e. some listed agent passes `pairB` (it holds only its top, is not a pair
  holder, and its `b`, `c` are junk); `pairChain_iff`: this is the negation of (P) (`PropP`).
- `OneExposure`: an exchange cycle with exactly one exposure arc: a free agent `o` that holds a good, an agent `x`
  exposed for `o` (`Exposed`), and a walk of need arcs from `x` back to `o`.
- `ShortMove`: one of the three (the paper's "short move").
- `nFree`: `|F|`, the number of listed free agents; `Eset o`: the listed agents exposed for `o` (`E_o`).

**Results.**
- `walk_ends_free` (the first step of the paper's proof): if `D` has no cycle, every walk along need arcs ends at a
  free agent: from every listed agent outside `up` some free agent is reachable (it is the start or the end of a
  walk of need arcs).
- `exposed_walk`: with no short move, the walk from an agent exposed for a free agent `o` that holds a good ends at
  a free agent other than `o`.
- `exposed_disjoint`: under (P), the sets `E_o` of two different agents outside `up` are disjoint (the remark after
  Lemma forced).
- `short_counts`: with no short move (and the hypotheses of the Improvement Lemma), `|F| ≥ 2`, `n ≥ |F|²`,
  `m ≥ n + |F|`, and `n ≥ 6` if `|F| = 2`.
- `prop_short` (**Proposition short**): `|F| ≥ 2`, `n ≥ 6`, `m ≥ 8`; and if `|F| ≥ 3`, then `n ≥ 9` and `m ≥ 12`.
  Here `n = agents.length` and `m = goods.length`.

**Choices where the prose leaves room.**
1. The vertices of `D` are the listed agents outside `up`, so both ends of a need arc are listed and outside `up`.
   `D` has no loops (`needArc_irrefl`), so a closed walk (`HasNeedCycle`) contains a cycle of distinct agents, and a
   walk from `x` to `o` contains a path; a free agent has no out-arc (`needArc_of_free`), so such a walk does not pass
   `o` before its end. The cycle `o → x → ⋯ → o` of `OneExposure` is thus the paper's cycle of `D⁺` with one
   exposure arc. (P) is not part of `OneExposure`: without (P) a pair chain applies anyway.
2. The paper's walk "ends" because `D` is acyclic and finite. Here the walk follows `walkMap` (a free agent stays, an
   agent with an out-arc moves to its out-neighbour `outNb`) for `|V|` steps, `V` the agents outside `up`; by
   pigeonhole (`exists_period`) it then sits on a cycle of `walkMap`, which is a fixed point (a free agent) because
   `D` has no cycle.
3. Counting. `n` and `m` are the lengths of the lists `agents` and `goods`; goods that nobody values may exist and are
   counted in `m`. The bound `m ≥ n + |F|` counts `n` distinct picks (every listed agent picks a good: pair holders
   their `b`, frozen agents a needed good, free agents a good by Lemma empty) and the `≥ |F|` protecting goods of one
   free agent, which are junk and hence nobody's pick. These are distinct members of `goods`, so `goods.Nodup` is
   not needed (and not assumed).
4. `n ≥ |F|²`: the lists `E_o`, `o ∈ F`, are disjoint (`exposed_disjoint`) and each has at least `|H_o| ≥ |F|`
   agents. For `|F| = 2` no free agent is exposed for a free agent (the paper's argument), so `F` and the two sets
   `E_o` give `n ≥ 2 + 2 + 2`.

/-- **Proposition short** (`paper/k3-simple/long.tex` §6.4, "when short moves are not enough"). In the core case, let
`(Y, up)` be a valid state in which no free agent is a valid absorber, some agent is not a pair holder, and no short
move applies (no need cycle, no pair chain, no exchange cycle with exactly one exposure arc). Then `|F| ≥ 2`, `n ≥ 6`
and `m ≥ 8`; if `|F| ≥ 3`, then `n ≥ 9` and `m ≥ 12` (`n = |agents|`, `m = |goods|`, `F` the free agents). -/
