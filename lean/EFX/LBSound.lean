# Soundness of construction LB (LEDGER S2.S, `proofs/construction.md` §3, Theorem 1)

Theorem 1 says that every allocation construction LB returns is EFX₀ for every additive valuation
consistent with the rankings, and has at most one bundle of more than two goods. Its proof uses only a
few properties of LB's output. This file states them as `Hyp` and proves that they imply both
conclusions.

A ranking profile `P` gives each agent `i` three goods `a i > b i > c i`. A valuation is consistent
with `P` (`Profile.Consistent`) if agent `i` values exactly these three goods, in this order, and is
balanced (`a i < b i + c i`), as every core agent is. An allocation `X` comes with picks
`Y : A → Option G` (LB's Phase 1), a set `U` of upgraded agents and an owner `o` (Phase 2).
`NA` is the set of goods that some agent outside `U` ranks above its pick (all three of its goods if
it has no pick). `Hyp` asks:
- `pick`: each pick is one of the picker's three goods, and the picker holds it;
- `i1`: invariant (I1): a good that an agent ranks above its pick was picked;
- `upgraded`: an agent of `U` picked its `b`, holds its `c`, and its `b` is not in `NA`; unless it is
  the owner, it holds nothing else (LB's implementation lets an upgraded agent own the large bundle);
- `frozen`: an agent outside `U` whose pick is in `NA` holds only its pick;
- `slots`: every other agent outside `U` except `o` holds at most 1 good beyond its pick, or at most
  2 goods if it has no pick;
- `owner`: if `o`'s bundle has more than two goods, it does not contain both `b k` and `c k` of an
  agent `k ≠ o` outside `U` whose pick is its top `a k` (the owner constraint).

Invariant (I2) and the order in which (I1) says goods were picked are not needed, and neither is
anything about how the junk was split beyond the slots; the theorem therefore covers every tie-break
and every choice of owner and overflow set.

- `EFX.LB.Hyp.efx0`: `Hyp` ⟹ EFX₀ over lists, for every consistent valuation.
- `EFX.LB.Hyp.length_le_two`: `Hyp` ⟹ every bundle except `o`'s has at most two goods.
- `EFX.LB.sound`: both, in the model's terms (`EFX.Inst.EFX0`).

As in the written proof, the argument uses only the envier's own values: L5 is not used.
